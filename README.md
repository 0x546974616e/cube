# Cube

Obfuscated C program rotating a cube in the terminal, but not obfuscated enough
(I think) to compete in [IOCCC](https://www.ioccc.org/) according to the fourth
goal: "To illustrate some of the subtleties of the C language".

## To build:

```sh
gcc cube.c -lm -o cube
```

## To use:

```sh
./cube
```
